            outside of web dev-->
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I was first introduced to Web Development when I was 21, by my older sister. She studied graphic
            design and I was amazed by how she was able to manipulate a webpage. She taught me basic CSS and some basic 
            HTML. When I was 26 I studied Intro to Web Dev at <a href = "https://www.bloomtech.com/">Lambda School </a>, 
            full time, and learned HTML and CSS indepth. I love being able to control and design an entire site, as 
            well as the fast paced learning environment and team atmosphere. I enjoy collaborating with others
            and learning from people who have more experience than I do, because it allows me room for growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from my interests in Web Development, I also have a passion for creative arts and learning. I am 
            a very creative person and I also like to learn as much as I can. I am a successful author, with my first book
            recently being released. I create custom blankets and artwork. I am very big on homemade items, and my children 
            and I currently create our own all natural dog treats, as well as all natural soap, and candles. 
            I also have a background in a multitude of different subjects. Learning is my passion.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have a Master of Wicca degree, and credentials of 
            Ministry. I studied Forensic Psychology with the <a href = "https://www.phoenix.edu/">
            University of Pheonix</a>, photography online at <a href = "https://www.skillshare.com/browse/photography">                
            Skillshare.com</a>, and am also currently studying cake decorating online at <a href = "https://www.craftsy.com/">Craftsy.com</a>. 
            I also did a tattoo apprenticeship in Las Vegas, Nevada, and currently do tattoos in my 
            freetime.
